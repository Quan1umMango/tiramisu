HSP is bringing to you a one of a kind, networking event where you get to meet the whole team of HSP; yes, all of them!

And we showcase what we've been up to since joining here :D

You get to see what we love to do in our free time, and you get to tick off all the things on your college starter todo, like:

- Find cool seniors
- Learn about the tools you use
- Talk about projects
- Find what you love to do
- Get started on your engineering journey :D

So what's keeping you back? Join us at Sem Hall 3, 5th Floor on September 3, 2:30 pm and catch all of us presenting our projects!
