# Club Restructure Announcement

**Note: With effect from Monday, 14th April 2025.**

To improve planning and ideation, member engagement and growth opportunities, the HSP core team has decided to adopt a flatter, more flexible community structure!

## Key Changes <br><br>

- Members will be reassigned to new roles - <span style="font-style:italic;color:#00fb6b">Mentors or Mentees</span> and will equally participate in all club activities and shared community forums.<br><br>
- <span style="font-style:italic;color:#00fb6b">Mentors and Mentees</span> are encouraged to volunteer and contribute to event-specific tasks, which will be coordinated by domain leads within the Core Team.<br><br>
- New Core Team Composition - <span style="font-style:italic;color:#00fb6b">Core Team Lead(s), Mentor & Mentee Lead(s), Operations Lead(s), Design Lead(s), Social Media & Marketing Lead(s).</span><br><br>
- The Core Team will be in charge of task allocation, event planning, documentation, and ensuring smooth execution through appropriate forums.<br><br>
- New Recruits will be picked for the roles of <span style="font-style:italic;color:#00fb6b">Mentor and Mentee</span> through a selection process involving technical challenges/tests and interviews.<br><br>
- The process will also include an evaluation of additional relevant skills (e.g. organizational experience, design, editing).<br><br>
- The exact nature and details of this process shall be decided by the new HSP core (2025-26).<br><br>
