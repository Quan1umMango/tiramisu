Modal editors are a unique class of text editors that let you work with text through different modes, making editing, navigation, and command execution faster and more efficient. Popular examples like Vim and Neovim are used by developers worldwide for their productivity, minimal keystrokes, and ability to adapt to individual workflows.

This hands-on workshop is designed to give you a strong foundation in modal editing. You’ll explore the core principles that make these editors powerful and see how their workflows can dramatically improve your coding speed and precision.

### What to expect:

- Learn the fundamentals of modal editing and why it’s different from traditional editors
- Get practical exposure to essential commands and editing techniques
- Discover how to customize and extend your editor to match your workflow
- Explore creative ways to integrate modal editors into your projects

> By the end, you’ll not only understand how modal editors work but also have the confidence to start using them in real-world projects. Whether you’re completely new or looking to sharpen your skills, this session will help you unlock a faster, smarter way to code.

## Prerequisites:

Just bring along your laptop — that’s all you need to get started. **Please install Neovim before the workshop to save time and get started quickly.**

#### Windows

1. Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**.
2. Install Neovim using [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) (Windows Package Manager):
    ```sh
    winget install Neovim.Neovim
    ```
3. Launch Neovim:
    ```sh
    nvim --version
    ```

<!-- > If you don’t have winget, [follow this guide to set it up](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/). -->

---

#### macOS

1. Open **Terminal**.
2. If you don’t have Homebrew, [install it first](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation).

3. Install Neovim:
    ```sh
    brew install neovim
    ```
4. Launch Neovim:
    ```sh
    nvim --version
    ```

#### Linux/ChromeOS

1. Open **Terminal**.
2. Install Neovim using your distribution’s package manager:

    - **Debian/Ubuntu:**
      ```sh
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install neovim
      ```
    - **Fedora:**
      ```sh
      sudo dnf install neovim
      ```
    - **Arch Linux:**
      ```sh
      sudo pacman -S neovim
      ```

3. Launch Neovim:
    ```sh
    nvim --version
    ```
