Tilde is essentially a mentorship program, the mentees selected here would be
working under the guidance of the project leads, where all decisions, code, and
other stuff is fully done my the mentees. The mentors job would be just to
point them in the right direction and help them understand what they are
working with.

Once the mentors of the projects have finalised their teams, given the short
duration, we first focus on onboarding the team as quick as possible, get them
familiar with what they are to be working with. Mentors would be providing
everyone with all sorts of resources to help the team out. The subsequent weeks
will be focused on working on the actual project. This is sort of a general
timeline, but it can be completely different depending on the project. (For
example, work on the actual project could begin as soon as the first day after
onboarding given that the team are familiar with their tools, and some could
take 1-2 weeks to just get introduced and get familiar with what they are
working with.)

To keep the teams accountable of their work, we will be holding these weekly
review calls where the team have to present their work done during the duration
of the previous week to a panel (who would contain members who are might/might
not be familiar with what your working with, so this should give you a small
idea of what to expect). Along with that, you would lay down what you would be
working on in the coming weeks. The purpose of this call is also to provide a
quick feedback to the team, and a few suggestions as well on what they’ve been
working with. 

Along with the mentors, you will be accompanied with “co-mentors” and a few
other people, they will be stalking around, may not be fully part of the mentor
team, but they would be around to give suggestions as well during the weeks,
besides the weekly reviews.

While Tilde only goes for 5 weeks, we encourage the teams to keep working on
their projects. Like the previous year, we plan to host a “road-show” during
the freshers orientation time, and another time in the quadrangle, to showcase
your work to the college
